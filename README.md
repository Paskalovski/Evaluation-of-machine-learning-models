# Evaluation-of-machine-learning-models

Evaluation of several applied machine learning models for fraud prediction

Application content:
- reading and analyzing the dataset
- calculating the percentage of the fraud instances in the dataset
- using the dummy classifier to classify the dataset and calculating the accuracy score and the recall score 
- using the SVC classifier to classify the dataset and calculating the accuracy score, recall score and precision score 
- using the SVC classifier to classify the dataset with parameters {'C': 1e9, 'gamma': 1e-07} and analyzing the confusion matrix
- using the logistic regression classifier to classify the dataset and analyzing the precision recall curve and the ROC curve
- performing a grid search over the defined parameters for a logistic regression and using recall for scoring and the default 3-fold cross validation
